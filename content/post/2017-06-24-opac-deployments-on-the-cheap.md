<span style="font-weight: 400;">On this Blog we’ve featured digital signage resources using free or low-cost software and hardware, including Porteus-Kiosk </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">running on flash drives and Chrome on ChromeBits.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been using Porteus-Kiosk for a couple of OPAC deployments in my library, but the initial setup and sluggish performance when running on a flash drive are less than optimal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to a recent tip from Darrell Eifert from the Lane Memorial Library, I’ve found an impressive alternative, and it’s called OpenKiosk.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This free and open-source browser is a fork of the Mozilla Firefox framework, sharing in its privacy and security foundation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve installed OpenKiosk on a donated computer running Linux Mint. Having a free OS, a free specialized browser that’s ideal for online catalog deployments, as well as a free computer, are all hard to beat. Configuring OpenKiosk is a breeze, especially if you’re already familiar with Firefox and its settings. OpenKiosk comes with additional settings relating to filtering content and other security behaviors to ensure a more secure browsing experience for public users in public libraries. It’s an ideal resource for OPAC deployments in public libraries, and it doesn’t at all hurt that it’s free, open-source, and very easy on system resources!</span>
