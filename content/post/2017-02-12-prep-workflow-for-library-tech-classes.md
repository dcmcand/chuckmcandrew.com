<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs a real pleasure to be part of this new blog for ‚Äútechie‚Äù librarians! It‚Äôs like having a new library space that‚Äôs just waiting to be filled with new books. I look forward to the exchange of ideas that this venue will afford us, and I can‚Äôt wait to read about (and also share) tips and tricks, best practices, successes as well as challenges, that we all face as ‚Äútechie‚Äù librarians in our respective libraries!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For my first post to this blog, I thought that I‚Äôd share how I prepare for the weekly tech classes that I teach here at the <a href="http://www.hooksettlibrary.org/" target="_blank">Hooksett Library</a>, and what tools I use as part of the process. The subject matter for the classes comes from various sources, including patron feedback about what they‚Äôre specifically interested in knowing more about, common tech support issues with patrons, the latest developments in the tech world, be it new releases of operating systems or common threads of discussion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with senior staff, I map out the next couple of months‚Äô worth of tech classes. Once the schedule is mapped on the calendar (and added </span><a href="http://www.hooksettlibrary.org/calendar/month" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as events on our website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the topics are now by default on my radar, as I continue my daily routine of reviewing my tech sources. These sources encompass tech blogs, social media with tech-related themes, and major news sites, to name a few. Over the years, I‚Äôve subscribed to numerous tech blogs, and I use </span><a href="https://feedly.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedly</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to aggregate and follow them daily. I also use </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†with customized news feeds to follow tech-related news of interest. Both social media platforms offer ways to save links for later consumption, but I also prefer to use a really cool bookmarking tool, called </span><a href="https://stash.ai" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It‚Äôs only in limited beta testing right now, but I managed to get in on the action by joining their wait-list. Stash is the brain-child of a couple of Cornell University students and uses artificial intelligence to organize the links that you bookmark with it. I also use </span><a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFTTT</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to send anything that I‚Äôve ‚Äústashed‚Äù with Stash, to send to my Twitter account, so that I‚Äôll have a backup of the articles that I‚Äôve ‚Äústashed,‚Äù just in case Stash doesn‚Äôt work out as a going concern.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next in the preparation process is the medium that I use to create the class materials. I use </span><a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Slides</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to accomplish this, and on occasion I‚Äôve also used </span><a href="https://sway.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sway</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from Microsoft. Google Slides is the usual go-to resources, since it‚Äôs an integral part of our Google Domain, affording the ease of collaboration and lots of useful features, not the least of which is the ability to share via embedding or PDF. For image content on the slides I often use </span><a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pixabay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others, and if I have to edit the images, my standby app of choice is </span><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paint.net</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once created in prep for a given class, I upload a PDF version of the slides on </span><a href="http://www.hooksettlibrary.org/technology-class-slides" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a page on our website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and as many of you already know, in the interest of sharing resources, I share them with you (my professional colleagues in the field) on our NHLA-ITS listserv. ~Mark üòÄ</span>
